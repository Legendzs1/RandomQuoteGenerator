{"1":"And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."},
{"2":"All grown-ups were once children... but only few of them remember it."},
{"3":"What makes the desert beautiful,' said the little prince, 'is that somewhere it hides a well..."},
{"4":"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."},
{"5":"The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart."},
{"6":"People have forgotten this truth,' the fox said. 'But you mustn’t forget it. You become responsible forever for what you’ve tamed. You’re responsible for your rose."},
{"7":"Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them"},
{"8":"You - you alone will have the stars as no one else has them...In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night...You - only you - will have stars that can laugh."},
{"9":"It is such a mysterious place, the land of tears."},
{"10":"Well, I must endure the presence of a few caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies."},
{"11":"You're beautiful, but you're empty...One couldn't die for you. Of course, an ordinary passerby would think my rose looked just like you. But my rose, all on her own, is more important than all of you together, since she's the one I've watered. Since she's the one I put under glass, since she's the one I sheltered behind the screen. Since she's the one for whom I killed the caterpillars (except the two or three butterflies). Since she's the one I listened to when she complained, or when she boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing at all. Since she's my rose."},
{"12":"You see, one loves the sunset when one is so sad."},
{"13":"You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed."},
{"14":"If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers..."},
{"15":"All men have stars, but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems... But all these stars are silent. You-You alone will have stars as no one else has them... In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars will be laughing when you look at the sky at night..You, only you, will have stars that can laugh! And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me... You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure... It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh"},
{"16":"And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure . . . And your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, 'Yes, the stars always make me laugh!' And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you..."},
{"17":"She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little stratagems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her..."},
{"18":"I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of crying a bit if one allows oneself to be tamed."},
{"19":"A rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the moment a single man contemplates it, bearing within him the image of a cathedral."},
{"20":"In those days, I didn't understand anything. I should have judged her according to her actions, not her words. She perfumed my planet and lit up my life. I should never have run away! I ought to have realized the tenderness underlying her silly pretensions. Flowers are so contradictory! But I was too young to know how to love her."},
